# Movie App Built With React

## All Data that integrates with the application comes from the The Movie Database API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

## Semantic UI was used for minor styling and this application uses custom CSS stylesheets.

#### The Home page showcases a slider that autoscrolls through upcoming movies. Below the main slider there are 2 buttons that allow you to choose to browse between movies and tv shows. 3 panels showcase movies that are now playing, tv shows that are now airing, popular movies/tv shows, and top rated movies/tv shows.

#### At the top of the application there is a search bar that lets you search the database for a specific movie or tv show and get some metadata about it.

#### If you click on a title, you will redirect to a page that has some basic information about the movie or tv show such as its title, release date/first air date, a small description, and some images.
